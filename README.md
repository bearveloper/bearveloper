I am a computer nerd and work as a Senior Web Developer; I've been doing this since 2005, so I've seen (and learned) a thing or two in all these years. I am a big fan of automation and try to use it whenever and wherever I can; call it scripts and macros to help me with my job and hobbies, home automation, and many other things.

You can find me in different places on the interwebs; I'll keep the following list updated for your convenience:
